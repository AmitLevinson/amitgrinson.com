  As you've noticed, I'm Amit Grinson (Levinson), a Data Scientist @ Meta. I currently live with my wife Tal, our boy Tom and dog Milo in Rehovot, Israel.  
  
  I've come across the R programming language during my MA in Sociology, actually by chance, and have been hooked on it since. I love the R community, data visualization challenges and more recently other languages such as SQL, Python and doing baby steps in JS.
  
  That's also what I blog about here. It could be curious questions I came across (such as probability, text-analysis) or challenges I faced somewhere, solved them and would like to share them with my future self or you.
  
  Hope you enjoy your visit and again, reach out so I can get to know you better ðŸ˜„
