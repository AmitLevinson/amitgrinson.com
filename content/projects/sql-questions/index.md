### Project Overview

As a Data Analyst who writes a lot of SQL, I find myself coming across challenges I solved that I'd love to share with others. 

This project (the website) is exactly that â€” Analytical challenges I encountered in work that required solutions with SQL. For each challenge I provide the questions, data that can be locally created, the solutions and a video I recorded going over the answer. Give it a go here:  

**[sql.amitgrinson.com](https://sql.amitgrinson.com)**

Note that the website is in Hebrew. I find myself writing a lot in English on my personal website and social media platforms that I found it a good opportunity to share stuff in Hebrew. 

Hope you enjoy!
